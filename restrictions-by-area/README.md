Tier list by Local Authority. Note, when Tiers were first rolled out the government assigned some Tiers by Ward. To keep things simple, we'll use lower tier local authority (i.e. boroughs, districts, unitary authorities).

Data is based on OGL sources, such as GOV.UK Corona Cases by Local Authority
