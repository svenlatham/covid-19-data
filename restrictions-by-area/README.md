# covid-19-data

This is a consolidation of data from github/alphagov that lists restrictions by local authority.
* 1 Oct - YAML published to list all places under "Level 2" restrictions on finder-frontend
https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend/pull/2218/commits/0b29d35b1b77112a0e3a51802cf940da30777be3

* 6 Oct - moved across to collections:
https://github.com/alphagov/collections/commit/586dbf865dbc452d734cbbebb3aef9b6aa5d2063

* 14 Dec - this was moved over to a different directory:
https://github.com/alphagov/collections/commit/34b254ca4b589e13198c779f2f72708023bcec4e

Note the format also changes. This repo is intended to track the complete list of changes (including those deleted on the active site).
I might even automate it at some point :-)

The following URLs trace the changes in each instance of the file:
https://github.com/alphagov/collections/commits/master/lib/local_restrictions/local-restrictions.yaml
https://github.com/alphagov/collections/commits/master/config/local_restrictions.yml
https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend/commits/master/app/lib/local_restrictions/local-restrictions.yaml
